Title: Bug: Auto-reject workflow not triggering on new issues

Body:
I noticed that when I create new issues, the auto-reject workflow doesn't seem to be running. The workflow file seems to be configured correctly but maybe there's a permissions issue or something else going wrong.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a new issue
2. Wait for auto-reject workflow to trigger
3. Nothing happens

Expected: Issue should be immediately closed with a dismissive comment
Actual: Issue stays open

Can someone look into this?
